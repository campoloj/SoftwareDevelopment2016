Ambiguities

1) Can the food tokens on the watering hole be reduced to a negative value? If so,
   does it remain negative for the next round or reset to 0?

2) If a turn ends (watering hole food reduced to 0) before a player turns their
   face down cards over, are they kept on the species board for the next turn
   or removed? If kept, can they be added to in the following turn?

3) Do "neighbors" (ex. trait 15) only include neighbors in the player's species boards,
   or can other player's species boards be neighbors as well?

4) Is there a limit to the number of species boards? If so, what happens to the species
   board when that species goes extinct?

5) What happens to the trait cards on a species board when that species extinct? Are they removed
   from the game or returned to the deck?

6) When a player trades in trait cards for additional population, body size, or species board, are
   those cards returned to the deck or removed from the game?

7) For the (6) Fat Tissue trait, is the total storable food equal to the larger value of
   population size and body size, or the combination of the two values?
