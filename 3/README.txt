The purpose of this project is to provide a protocol for server/player interactions and to show patches made to our
previous 6Nimmt! implementation.

/take5 - contains patches for 6Nimmt! implementations
player.py - implements the previously designed player interface
player-protocol.txt - interaction diagram and data definitions for server/player communication

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use this program, pull the git repository
and enter the following command from the directory the git repo is located in:
python cs4500-lidauch-jcamp/2/take5/Assignment_2.py <number of players> <starting player>
where <number of players> and <starting player> are integers
and <starting player> is between 0-<number of players>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The player file should be read first from top to bottom.
Next the files in /take5 can be read in the order described in take5/README.txt.
Finally the player-protocol.txt can be read from top to bottom.
