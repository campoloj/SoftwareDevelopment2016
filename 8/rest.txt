Select Cards to play from the TraitCards in the hand
Given their hand and their species, returns a list of actions which specify
which of the players cards are being used for what purpose and on which species.

This happens when in step 3 of a turn when:
each player may supplement any of his species with additional face-up cards, up to three;
may place a face-down card on top of a card already associated with a species;
or may exchange cards for: additional species boards, growing the body size, or increased population sizes.
Specifically, one card is worth one of the following:
    one new species board,
    one additional body size (for one specific species, or one additional animal also for one specific species.)

An Action is one of:
# Add selected TraitCards to selected Species (up to three cards per species).
{"supplement-species": (Species, List-of-TraitCard)},

# Place face-down TraitCard (first) on top of face-up TraitCard (second) to replace it on selected Species
{"replace-trait": (Species, TraitCard, TraitCard)},

# Trade in a TraitCard to add a new species on the "left" or "right" side of their current species boards
{"add-species": (TraitCard, String)},

# Trade in a TraitCard to increase the body size of the selected Species
{"grow-body": (TraitCard, Species)},

# Trade in a TraitCard to increase the population size of the selected Species
