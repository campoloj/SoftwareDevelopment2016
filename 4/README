The purpose of this project is to implement a remote proxy player, create unit test files for JSON in and out
messages, and create a data definition for the Evolution game.

remote/remote-client.py: The main function for the remote proxy player
remote/globals.py:  Global variables used in remote/
remote/convert.py: Object containing static methods to convert to/from JSON messages
test/*: 5 different in/out pairs of JSON messages
evolution/ambiguities.txt: document with questions to clarify rules of evolution
evolution/Diagram.jpg: UML diagram for evolution objects

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To run the files in remote/ cd into the remote directory and run "remote-client.py" for windows or "python remote.py"
for linux boxes.

remote/remote-client.py should be read first from top to bottom using remote/convert.py and remote/globals.py as references.
remote/convert.py should be read next from top to bottom.
test/* should be read next. The files should be read in in/out pairs starting with pair number one.
evolution/Diagram.jpg should be looked at next.
