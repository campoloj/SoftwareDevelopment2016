# SoftwareDevelopment2016

Projects from Professor Matthias Felleisen's [Spring 2016 Software Development class] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/index.html). Project descriptions are detailed in the Projects, Specifics page.

Directories 1 through 4 are progressive implementations of the [6Nimmit! game] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/take5.html),
while directories 5 through 14 are implementations of the [Evolution game] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/evolution.html).
Each directory contains a specific README detailing the goal of the project, the executables, and how to read the files. Directory 14 contains the final implementation of Evolution, which is cable of being played locally or remotely against AI. The preceding directories are included to display a history of incremental improvement, both in developing the game and in my software development skill.

The first six projects were collaborative with [Lydia Auch] (https://github.com/lydiaauch), and the last eight with [Sam Lucyk] (https://github.com/SamLucyk).
